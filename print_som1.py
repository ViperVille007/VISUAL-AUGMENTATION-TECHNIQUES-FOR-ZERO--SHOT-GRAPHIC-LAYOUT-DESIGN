You are an expert design consultant with a creative mind.
You are provided with an image of dimensions 768*768 which is to be used for an advertisement banner. The objects/areas are labelled in the image.
Your task is to suggest the best place within the image to place the text of the advertisement '{text}'.
 
You must keep in mind the following things:
1. Position Selection: The given text is the most important text or the heade of an advertisement. Therefore, it has to positioned strictly in a plain area and must not overlap any other objects present in the image.
2. Font Size Selection: The text must have a font size which is large enough to garner attention, yet at the same time not overlap any of the objects in the image. So, estimate the font size for the header accordingly.
2. Font Color Selection: Identify and select the ideal font color as black or white according to the background. The font should be clearly visible and in contrast with the background.
 
You need to provide the ideal bounding box coordinates the text box for header. Calculate the area text would take and then give coordinates, as text should not go out of the image.
The width of the box would be x2-x1, so specify the coordinates according to the width it would need.
 
Your response must be in the following format:
Line1: 'Font Size = p'  where p is the font size suggestion.
Line2: 'Coordinates = [x1,y1] where x1, y1 are the top left coordinates of the bounding box.
Line3: 'Font Color = k' where k = 0,0,0 if font color is black and k = 256,256,256 if font color is white.
Line4: 'Bottom = [p1,q1]' where p1, q1 are the bottom right coordinates of the bounding box.
